## Prerequisites
When you have purchased Corebot from one of the above websites, you should have the option to download the latest version.

2. React with the âœ… emoji on the welcome message in the `#verify` channel.
3. Navigate to the `verification` ticket category.
4. Provide the information requested by the bot to get your license!

## Configuring your bot
You should now have a license key and a zip file containing the Corebot files. Let's start installing them!

Navigate to your Fragify's server [File Manager](../../fragify/file-manager.md) and upload the zip file by dragging it into the file manager or using the "Upload" button.

Then extract the zip file by clicking on the **Unarchive** button.

Key: "BOT-KEY-HERE"
```

Add your **Discord Bot Token** under `Token` and your **Corebot License Key** under `Key`.
