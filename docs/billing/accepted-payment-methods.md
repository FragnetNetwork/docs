# What forms of payment does Fragnet accept?

Currently, we are accepting most major credit cards through PayPal/Stripe and regular bank transfers.

Do have in mind that you can pay by Credit/Debit Card without registering a PayPal account at PayPal.

Payment Methods :

*   PayPal
*   Credit/Debit Card
*   Bank Transfer
*   Stripe

  
Keep in mind that if you select the "Bank Transfer" method, you MUST contact us via support ticket and send proof of payment, as our system can't detect bank transfers automatically.
