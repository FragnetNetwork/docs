# You charged me even after I cancelled?

We never charge any client or store any credit card information or other similar data. All payments have to be initiated by the client.  
When cancelling your service with us, please cancel any recurring _PayPal_ subscriptions you have set up with _PayPal_. Otherwise, the invoice will be automatically paid again even though you no longer have a service with us.  
  
Please follow the steps below to cancel an active _PayPal_ subscription:  
   
1\. Navigate to the _PayPal_ site and login to your account.  
2\. Look up your last payment with us and click on the _"Details"_ button of that payment.  
3\. It will say at the top of the payment details something about a recurring subscription, and it will give you the option to cancel your recurring subscription with us.  

As always, if you have any questions or need assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us!
