# Becoming an admin on ARK server
In case you want to add an admin password that you can use to identify as the owner of the server and to gain control over your server while in-game, you can follow the next steps:


## Setting Admin Password
**Step 1:** Login to the [Fragify panel](VAR::FRAGIFY_URL) and select your ARK server.

**Step 2:** Navigate to the **Configure** option on the left side menu.

**Step 3:** In `Base Settings`, you will find the **Admin Password** variable, and you can input the password you would like to use.

The admin password has been successfully set now. For these changes to be reflected, restart your server.

## Admin Console Usage
While in-game on the server, you can click on the `tab` key, which will open a console window at the bottom part of the screen.

You can type the following command and press `Enter`:
```
enablecheats yourAdminPassword
```
Afterwards, you will become an admin, and you can use any commands. 

:::note
If you rejoin your server again, you will need to repeat the previous step to be able to use all commands.
