# Adding modpack to your Minecraft server

You can easily install modpacks on your Minecraft server in [Fragify panel](VAR::FRAGIFY_URL).

1. Login to your account and navigate to your server. You should see options on the left-side menu, and one of them will be **Modpacks** under the `Tools` section. 

2. After selecting the **Modpacks** option, you can search for the modpack you would like to install on the server.
