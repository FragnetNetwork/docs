**Step 5:** Find a mod you want to enable on your server and download it to your PC. After the download is completed, make sure to save it somewhere where the mod is easily reachable.  

**Step 6:** After downloading all the mods, you can drag and drop them in the **Mods** folder or use **Upload** button.

**Step 7:** Select the archive of the mod that you have uploaded and click on **...**  , then select option **Unarchive**.
