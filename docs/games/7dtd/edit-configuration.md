Now when you want to edit the config file go to **File Manager** and select **myserverconfig.xml**. This will open editor window and you can change values of variables to your preferences. Don't forget to click on **Save Content**.
Next to every command in the file there will be an explanation about the property you want to change.

## Custom Configuration File
