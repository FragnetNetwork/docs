# What is Fragify?

Let's discover **Fragify in less than 5 minutes**.

## Behind the panel

Fragify is a custom fork of [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/), an open-source game server management panel.

### What features does Fragify offer?

<u>By default, all servers get access to:</u>

- **Full File Access** - Upload, edit, and delete any file on your server - no strings attached.
- **MySQL Databases** - Create and manage MySQL databases for your server.
- **Scheduled Tasks** - Schedule tasks to run on your server at a specific time.
- **Offsite Backups** - Create backups of your server at a remote location and never worry about losing your data. Backups are retained for up to 30 days after you cancel your server.
