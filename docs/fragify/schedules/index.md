Schedules allow you to run commands or actions on your server at a specific time or interval. This can be used to automate tasks such as backing up your server, or running a console command or restarting your server.

:::info
Schedules use the UTC timezone. If you are not familiar with UTC, you can use [this tool](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html) to convert your local time to UTC.
