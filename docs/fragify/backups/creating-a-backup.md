### Manual backup

You can create a backup of your server at any time by heading over to your server's **Backups** tab and clicking the **Create Backup** button.

### Scheduled backup

You can also create a backup schedule to automatically create backups of your server at a specific time or interval. To do this, head over to your server's **Schedules** tab and [create a new schedule](../schedules/creating-a-schedule.md). Then, add a new task to the schedule and select the **Create backup** option.
