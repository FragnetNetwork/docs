You can download an existing backup of your server at any time by heading over to your server's **Backups** tab and clicking the **Download** button next to the backup you want to download.

This will provide you with a .tar.gz archive of your server's files which you can then extract using an archive manager such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) if you are on Windows.
