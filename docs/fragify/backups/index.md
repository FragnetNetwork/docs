Backups allow you to create a copy of your server's essential files and configurations.

We also offer the ability to create backups of your MySQL databases.

:::warning
Any configuration changes made under the "Configure" tab are not backed up. This is something that we will change on a future update.

:::info
All backups are stored in an underground data-bunker (former nuclear fallout shelter) in France so that your data is always secure and isolated from natural or technological risks.

## Backup limits
The total number of backups depends on the package you have purchased.

All servers are limited to 3 backups per day. Any additional backups may fail.  
Please reach out to us if you need to create more than 3 backups per day.
